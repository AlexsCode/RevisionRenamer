# RevisionRenamer
A Simple File Renamer

<b>Purpose:</b> Easily create multiple renamed files faster than manually.

<b>Reason:</b> In the Design/Construction industry there is alot of Raw file outputs created.
There is a constant process of sending off and reviewing models at various revisions and iterations of the original.
Often a model may have 10+ associated models and files and thus becomes a labourous task to rename each output used.

<b>Solution:</b> Utilising a model tracking register to export the filenames & revisions alongside this tool to create a set of the files with revisions attached.

<b>Input Data Set Required:</b> All registers contain the model names and revisions within the same row.
